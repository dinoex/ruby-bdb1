<p>This interface if for the version 1.85 and 1.86 of Berkeley DB (for Berkeley
version &gt;= 2 see bdb) </p>
<p>Developers may choose to store data in any of several different
storage structures to satisfy the requirements of a particular
application. In database terminology, these storage structures and the
code that operates on them are called access methods.</p>
<p>The library includes support for the following access methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>B+tree: Stores keys in sorted order, using a default function that does
     lexicographical ordering of keys.</li>
<li>Hashing: Stores records in a hash table for fast searches based
     on strict equality, using a default that hashes on the key as a bit
     string. Extended Linear Hashing modifies the hash function used by the
     table as new records are inserted, in order to keep buckets underfull in
     the steady state.</li>
<li>Fixed and Variable-Length Records. Stores fixed- or
     variable-length records in sequential order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acces Methods</p>

<li><a href="docs/hashlike1.html">Hash like interface</a>
      these are the common methods for BDB1::Btree, BDB1::Hash</li>
<li><a href="docs/arraylike1.html">Array like interface</a>
      methods for BDB1::Recnum (same than BDB1::Recno)</li>
